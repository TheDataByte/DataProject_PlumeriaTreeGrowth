# DataProject_PlumeriaTreeGrowth
How fast is my plumeria tree growing? A repo for plumeria tree fans to help monitor growth inside the house. 

# Background
I love plumeria trees! I recently purchased one from Home Depot and am keeping it inside the house. I am a plant killer so I am trying not to kill my plant. At first I thought that it wasn't growing, but then after I was away for a while I noticed a few of the leaves grew quite a few inches! I have started to monitor my plant every so often to see how much it's growing. I might have too much time on my hands right now but I figured this data data would be helpful for others trying to grow plumerias as well.

Leaf growth over time

There are two branches with a bunch of leaves at the crest, I am just measuring the leaves at the top of the main branch. Obviously there are days when I am not around to measure and/or forget. I just hold up my ruler next to the leaves and estimate how long the leaf is, +/- half an inch or so.
